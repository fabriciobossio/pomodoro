## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a "pomodoro," the Italian word for tomato (after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student).

The technique follows these basic steps:
1. Decide on the task to be done
2. Set the timer to 25 minutes (one pomodoro)
3. Work on the task until the timer rings
4. Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes)
